  title: Unpacking ChatGPT
  short_intro: | 
    In the first part of this video, I, a Brazilian software engineer, break
    down the fascinating world of ChatGPT. I'll explain the neural networks that
    power it, how words are transformed into vectors to understand meaning, and
    the architecture behind models like ChatGPT. We'll also touch upon the
    concept of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), discuss the power
    consumption and potential dangers of these powerful AI tools, and consider
    how they are becoming increasingly integrated into our daily lives.

    Defesa de Mestrado - Efeito da Hibridização Dinâmica de
    Meta-Heuristicas em Um Sistema Multiagentes Distribuído e Escalável 
  short_intro: |
    In this presentation, which is my dissertation defense, I delve into the
    dynamic hybridization of metaheuristics within a multi-agent distributed
    system. I'll walk you through the architecture I developed, explaining how
    agents and regions interact to solve complex optimization problems. You'll
    see the experiments I conducted to evaluate the system's scalability and the
    impact of diverse search strategies on solution quality. Finally, I'll share
    my conclusions and thoughts on future research in this exciting field.

  title: Do Pão de Queijo ao Pastel de Nata 
  short_intro: |
    Join me as I recount my academic and professional journey, from my early 
    tech curiosity in Brazil to my current work in Portugal. I'll share the 
    challenges I faced, the transformative power of programming marathons,
    my experiences studying abroad, and the path that led me to roles at 
    companies like Uber and now Evernote. It's a story about perseverance, 
    the importance of practical experience, continuous learning, and chasing your dreams.

  title: Avaliação da Latência em um Sistema Multiagentes Distribuído 
  short_intro: | 
    In this video, I explain how I evaluated latency in a distributed
    multi-agent system, which was a key part of my master's work. I'll use an
    analogy of sending letters to help you understand message exchange and then
    dive into the architecture of the system I built, where agents search for
    solutions to optimization problems and regions store these solutions. I'll
    share my findings on how the system's performance, specifically message
    latency, changes as we vary the number of nodes, and discuss what this means
    for computational resources and scalability.

  title: O Cluster do CEFET-MG e Como Utilizar os Seus Recursos  
  short_intro: |
    In this video, I dive into the world of high-performance computing using 
    clusters, explaining complex parallel processing concepts with a fun pizza 
    analogy! I'll give you a tour of the CEFET cluster, including its hardware 
    and software, and show you how to access and utilize its resources. 
    We'll also explore different parallelism strategies, tools, 
    and languages like Julia, designed to get the most out of powerful computing environments.
