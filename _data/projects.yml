    With the growing of the big cities, the advent of self-driving cars and the smart-cities related technology the idea of using 
    classical intersection management such as semaphores doesn't take any advantage of all technology embedded in vehicles today.
    This project aims to create a distributed intersection management where cars communicate with a software artifact that manages
    each intersection, allowing them to cross the intersection without stopping and free of hassle. I participate in this project
    coordinating undergrad students, leading meetings, defining project priorities, making code reviews and planning experiments.

  short: Distributed multi-agent system for optimization

    Looking into the populations of insects, birds, mammals, we observe that collaboration is an 
    important component for adaptation and survival. But if you come closer, this collaboration doesn't
    happen in a homogeneous environment. Even really simple insects like ants are different from one to another, 
    and have may have different tasks. No single ant is really good at cutting and carrying, but many ants together 
    can cut an entire leaf and carry it to the anthill in minutes. The diversity of ants is a strong factor on the population success.
    With that in mind, this project studied the diversity and collaboration of a multi-agent system for combinatorics and non-combinatorics problems. 
    This project was codded in Java, with Akka and Cassandra. The analysis was made with Python.

  short: "An aritificial life simulator"
  description: | 
    This project aimed to reproduce a top-down model of an artificial nervous system. In a situated-cognition perspective, 
    creatures endowed with such a nervous system are capable of naviagate in a virtual world, interact with nutrients, 
    and learn how to keep it's homeostasis and survive. This project was implemented inside the Artifical Intelligence Lab in 
    CEFET-MG. I started as a Java Developer early in my tech high-school and carried many features in this project such as 
    its refactoring to a client-server architecture, data analysis and extraction layer, new control UI, and the port to 
    the Actor library Akka.
