After popularization of ChatGPT a lot of promises where made and noise were  
formed arround the possibility of LLMs being the next step to the so called 
AGI (Artificial General Intelligence). 
Many people are concerned and fear losing their jobs to the AGI. 
This toughts comes from the lack of perception on how the 
Large Language Model that powers ChatGPT works. 
In this talk we will explore the fundamentals of artificial neural networks and 
break all known ChatGPT parts into basic math constructs that might be easier
to understand. 
After that we can argue that, although these LLMs got very general in the task 
of language understanding, we are already reaching a plateau in the 
quality of the models. 
This stagnation shows how far they are from a true general intelligence, 
capable of inventing and adapting to new scenarios.
