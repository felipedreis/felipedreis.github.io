        Looking into the populations of insects, birds, mammals, we observe that collaboration is an 
        important component for adaptation and survival. But if you come closer, this collaboration doesn't
        happen in a homogeneous environment. Even really simple insects like ants are different from one to another, 
        and have may have different tasks. No single ant is really good at cutting and carrying, but many ants together 
        can cut an entire leaf and carry it to the anthill in minutes. The diversity of ants is a strong factor on the population success.
