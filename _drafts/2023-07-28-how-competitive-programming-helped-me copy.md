  I gave a talk to students of Competitive Programming at my Alma Mater on how my experience on competitive programming prepared me for 
  going through the frustration of layoff and helped my to find a job I wanted

The world went through a lot in the past three years, and the technology market didn't stay outside. Before the COVID-19 pandemic I was still working  in Brazil in the public sector. The salaries weren't very different from the private sector, plus I had stability. As 2020 started together with the  quarantine, we saw a growing research for professionals, and a raise in compensation as well. A lot of people left the public sector to earn more, some people started working in freelance jobs, making use of the free time they had not commuting to their full time job. I was one of those people. 

Even after moving to Portugal, where the salaries are known not to be the highest in Europe, talking with people around me, I saw a relevant increase in compensation until 2022. Everything was fine until I was hit by the news of Evernote (my previous employer) being acquired by an Italian company called Bending Spoons. After a few months the rummors of a layoff became true in Feb 2023 and I was one of the first impacted. Everything happened very fast albeit very human due to amazing manager I had there. 

The same day I received the news I got back to job search, something I didn't practice very strongly since the end of 2020. I knew I had to go through some basic resume update, presentation training and algorithm problems, obviously. I don't really mind algorithms, they aren't a problem for me. I was a competidor in ICPC regionals and latter a coach for two successful teams. What really gets me uncofortable and I think most of people as well is the tension of coding in front another person.

To get confidence I solved a few leetcode problems, mainly regarding the hardest topics like dynamic programming and graphs. After 5 months, 53 candidated CV sent, I interviewed with 19 companies in many rounds of technical and behavioural interviews,  I got accepted by 5 of them. This was really a marathon, and reminded my my time as ICPC competitor. When I finally got an offer, I realized how much a competitive programming background helped me to handle technical and personal aspects of this challange. Talking about those ideas with a professor and friend at CEFET-MG, my <em>alma mater</em>, he convinced me to give a talk to the Competitive Programming classroom. I did it at the end of the term, and you may check the recordings here.

In my presentation I resumed my learnings in 3 simple topics: The 4th problem, the black baloon and the best class. The 4th problem relates to my first experience as competitor. When I first went to a competition back in 2014 I thought I knew something about programming. I had a technician degree, I was almost in the middle of my undergrad, I had good grades. And it was hard. The first three problems were hard to pass, and the 4th one was almost impossible. And this also happened in the second competition, and the third one. With the trainning I always got the third problem faster then in the previous event, leaving more time to thing on the 4th problem, but <strong><em>there was always something I didn't know</em></strong>.
