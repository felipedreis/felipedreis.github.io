* we relate software abstractions to other engineering fields components like
  gears in mechanical engineering, blocks in civil engineering, atoms and molecules

* code is actually a recipe to solve a problem, no metter how complex it is

* relating code to gears in a engine for example is a misunderstanding of what is 
a code artifact and what is how an engine works. 

* There's no such a thing as an abstract gear that I can reuse or replace for another
"implementation" of such an idea of a gear. 

* an engine is built taking in account the specification for the use, the building 
materials, etc. If something breaks, it has to be substitute for the most similar 
piece possible
