title: Review of a call for embodied IA 
---

This paper by Giuseppe Paolo, Jonas Gonzalles-Billandon and Balázs Kégl proposes
that current machine learning techniques wont guide us through the path of 
a general artifical intelligence. The paper is organized in 3 main sections, 
the first one 

As humans interact with the SMAI they cnage recomendations and produce new data
to train these algorithms, producing a selective presure, but the drawback shows as


[^1] "Embodied cognition forms a critical part of the 4E cognitive science framework
(Varela et al, 1991) encompassing embodied, enactive, embeded and extended aspects of
cognition [...] EAI focused on implementing the embodied and enactive aspects,
where the embedded and extended components are more pertinent to situating AI 
in a social contect and as an augmentation of human cognition"

[^2] "In TAME perspective, cognition is not just an attribute of higher-order 
organism, it extend throughout the ontological hierarchy of living beigns, from 
individual cells throug tissues, and orgnas, to complex organisms"

[^3] About SMAI beign close to embodied: "Although the goals are initially human-designed
and not intrinsically generated [...] they are subject to evolutionary presure 
and adaption, and they are tied to the existence and survival of the SMAI. 
[...] these systems [...] morphs into mechanisms that perpetuate adictive behaviours or 
harmful content"

[^4] "We propose that true understanding not only propositional truth but also the value
of propositions that guide us how to act, is achivable only throug EAI agents that live
in the world and learn it by intercating with it"

[^5] " [...] vital role of embodied intercation in shapping cognitive abilities [...] 
all known forms of intelligence [...] are inherently embodied"

[^6] "We humans learn by seeing, moving, interacting with the world and speaking
with others [...] we learn by collecting experiences, not by passive observation 
of shuffled and randomized, even if careful selected, data"

[^7] "Such systems should be designed to learn through active interaction with their
surroundings mirroring the embodied learning process fundamental to human cognition
[...] multimodal learning is the next milestone towards AGI"

[^8] "[...] the focus in AI development transitions from data to simulators [...] the process
of aligning these agents with human values become more intuitive, as it involves
defining goals reflective of these values"

[^9] "[...] coupling between agent and environment, is the agent's capacity for ongoing
evolution and adaption. Thus adaptability is vital for any agent destined to navigate a
world in perpetual change"

[^10] "close and effective integration of control mechanisms with body dynamics significantly
enhances energy efficiency"
* "[...] preciselly realizing affordances is afundamental capacity of AGI, as affordances
are what fill our world with meaning" apud (Roli et al. 2002)
* "Affordances emerge from the dynamic interplay between agents perception, objectives,
abilities and the characteristics of objects and contexts with the environment"
* "The concepts of active inference and free energy principle provide a compelling
framework for understanding the behaviour of intelligent agents. This principles
posits that minimizing surprise and uncertainty is the core objective of the agents"
* "[...] essential components of EAI: perception, action, memory and learning"
